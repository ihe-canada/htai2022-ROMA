Core files available:
# HTAi2022 ToyMarkov
The script for creating the base case Markov Model, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis and key results

# HTAi2022 ToyMarkov_Deterministic
A simplified version of the base case model that only generates deterministic values. Not worth much analytically, but potentially helpful if you're new to HTA in R

# HTAi2022 VOI
The script for performing Value of Information analysis on the results of the ToyMarkov model.
You must have the HTAi2022ToyMarkov R Workspace saved on the working directory to successfully run this script, or run the ToyMarkov.R file first, followed by this file (ignoring the load() command on line 6.
